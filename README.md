# RepoSense 🚀

**Git Repository Intelligence & Automation Toolkit**

RepoSense is a backend system that monitors Git repositories, tracks commit activity, detects branch states (including Detached HEAD), and generates actionable analytics. It is designed for developers who want **visibility, automation, and reliability** in their Git workflows.

---

## 🔍 What Problem RepoSense Solves

- No visibility into **commit frequency & patterns**
- Hard to detect **Detached HEAD** and unsafe Git states
- No centralized way to **track pushes, branches, and repo health**
- Manual Git workflows = error-prone

RepoSense turns Git activity into **structured data + insights**.

## ✨ Features

### 📊 Commit Analytics
- Commit count
- Timeline tracking
- Repository activity metrics

### 🌿 Branch Detection
- Current branch identification
- Detached HEAD detection
- Branch change tracking

### 🚨 Safety & Recovery
- Detects unsafe Git states
- Helps recover from Detached HEAD scenarios

### 🔄 Automation Ready
- Designed to plug into scripts, cron jobs, or CI
- Structured logs and metrics

### ⚙️ Backend Metrics Layer
- API endpoints for repo insights
- Extensible metrics architecture

## 📡 API Endpoints (Sample)

| Method | Endpoint                 | Description              |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| GET    | `/api/analytics/commits` | Commit activity metrics  |
| GET    | `/api/analytics/branch`  | Current branch & state   |
| GET    | `/api/analytics/health`  | Repository health report |

## ⚠️ Detached HEAD Detection

RepoSense automatically detects:

* Detached HEAD state
* Unsafe commits
* Missing branch pointers

This helps prevent **lost commits** and broken histories.

---

## 🧩 Use Cases

* Developer productivity analytics
* Git workflow monitoring
* CI/CD pre-check validation
* Repo health dashboards
* Learning Git internals

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap

* [ ] Web dashboard UI
* [ ] GitHub webhook integration
* [ ] Multi-repo monitoring
* [ ] Alerting system (Slack / Email)
* [ ] Commit quality scoring
